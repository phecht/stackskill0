From stackskills.com Learn how to code

This is a repository of my code I have gleened from stackskills.com and other sources.  Such as blogs.golang.org, projectEuler and Learning go.

THe projectEuler code is original and solves two of the questions, 5 and 11. 
Thanks for looking!  

I'm currently looking for Go work to start in early March, 2018.
